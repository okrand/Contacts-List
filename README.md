This is a simple contacts list app that allows user to add and delete contacts. Contacts can be related to one another. It also lets users add a photo of each contact using the built in camera which can be maximized or minimized. The app uses fragments to better utilize space on landscape mode. It also uses the built in MySQL database to store data.
